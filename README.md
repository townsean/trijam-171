# trijam-171
Source code for Ashley's Trijam #171 entry. The theme is "Watch your step."  I like to add an additional constraint of only being able to use native HTML and JavaScript with no HTML5 canvas. 

[Trijam](https://itch.io/jam/trijam-171) is a weekly game jam where the goal is to create a game in under 3 hours of development time.

Total Dev Time: < 3 hours.  I was able to leverage some code from a previous Trijam. 

## Synopsis

**Wrong Step, You Fall** is a memory based game where you are stuck in a cave trying to safely find your way out. 

Select the wrong tile and you'll fall.

Use *arrow keys* or *WASD* to move your character around.  *Mouse click* to inspect a tile before stepping on it. Use this ability wisely. There is a limited number of times where an inspection can be used.
